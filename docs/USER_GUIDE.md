3. This creates a copy of the repository in your account

### Step 2: Create Your Request File

1. In your forked repository, navigate to the `requests/` directory
2. Create a new file named `your-subdomain.json` (replace with your desired subdomain)
3. Use the following template:

  "owner": {
    "username": "your-github-username",
    "email": "your-email@example.com"
  },
